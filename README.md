## Overview

This library allows you to extract the publication date of an article or a blog post by using various parsing methods. It's heavily inspired by both the original [Python version](https://github.com/Webhose/article-date-extractor) as well as the [Haskell port](https://github.com/amir/article-date-extractor).

Please consult the [documentation](https://docs.rs/article-date-extractor) for installation instructions and a usage example.
